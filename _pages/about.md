I am Guowen Sun, a final year PhD student, from the Department of the Mechanical, Aerospace, and Civil Engineering at the University of Sheffield. I am currently wating for the viva. I am under supervision of [Dr Christophe Pinna](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/mac/people/mech-eng-academic-staff/christophe-pinna), [Prof. Patrick Fairclough](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/mac/people/mech-eng-academic-staff/patrick-fairclough), and [Dr Matt Smith](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/amrc/amrc-research-staff/matt-smith). I finished my Master study at the Unversity of Sheffield with major in the Advanced Mechanical Engineering. I obtained Distinction degree. For the undergraduate study, I am graduated from the ChangChun Institute of Technology (CIT) and attended 3+1 programme to the University of the West of Scotland (UWS) at the final year. I obtained first-class honor degree for my undergraduate study in the UWS. 

Research Scope
======
PhD Project:

My project focuses on the developement of the multiscale modelling framework for the TFP composite based on the experimental characterisation. A standard workflow was built for multiscale experimental characterisation of the composite material. This involves to use SEM and X-ray Microscope (XRM) to characterise fibre distribution behaviour (microscale), fibre bundle structure (mesoscale), and laminate morphology (macroscale). Both ex-situ and in-situ characterisation was conducted using the XRM. Automative construction process of numerical models in the microscale for Representative Volume Element (RVE) model and in the mesoscale for Representative Unit Cell model was achieved.

My Research Interests
======
1. Composite manufacturing simulation
2. Multiscale simulation
3. Multiscale experimental characterisation
4. Mechanical properties and strength prediction
5. Tailored Fibre Placement
6. Digital Image/Volume Correlation
7. Image processing
8. Automative simulation
