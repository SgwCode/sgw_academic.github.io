I am Guowen Sun, a graduated PhD specialising specialising in advanced computational modelling and experimental characterisation of composites. I received my PhD in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Sheffield under the supervision of [Dr Christophe Pinna](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/mac/people/mech-eng-academic-staff/christophe-pinna), [Prof. Patrick Fairclough](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/mac/people/mech-eng-academic-staff/patrick-fairclough), and [Dr Matt Smith](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/amrc/amrc-research-staff/matt-smith), focusing on multiscale experimental characterisation and numerical simulation of tailored fibre placement (TFP) composites. My research bridges numerical simulation and experimental validation, with expertise in finite element modelling, digital volume correlation, and image‑based composite characterisation.

I have collaborated with industrial partners, including the Advanced Manufacturing Research Centre (AMRC), to develop innovative modelling strategies for predicting the performance and damage evolution of complex composite structures.

I hold a Master’s degree in Advanced Mechanical Engineering from [University of Sheffield](https://sheffield.ac.uk/) and a Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering from [University of the West of Scotland](https://www.uws.ac.uk/) and a Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Design and Automation from [Changchun Institute of Technology](https://en.ccit.edu.cn/).

Research Scope
======
PhD Project:

My PhD research focused on the multiscale modelling and experimental characterisation of tailored fibre placement (TFP) composites, with the aim of optimising manufacturing parameters and predicting mechanical performance. I developed integrated numerical–experimental approaches that combined finite element analysis, image‑based modelling from X‑ray computed tomography and scanning electron microscopy, and digital volume correlation. These methods enabled a detailed investigation of the influence of fibre architecture on strain localisation, crack initiation, and damage evolution, providing insights for the design of high‑performance composite structures in aerospace and automotive applications.
