title: "3D characterisation of local deformation and damage development in tailored fibre placement-manufactured composites under tensile loading"
collection: publications
category: conferences
permalink: /publication/conference_2
excerpt: 'This work, presented at SAMPE 2024 in PPT form, explores the tensile response and 3D strain evolution of TFP‑manufactured CFRP composites using in‑situ μXCT and a newly developed Python‑based DVC algorithm. The methodology reveals how resin‑rich regions around stitching threads influence damage development, providing valuable insight and validation tools for multiscale mechanical modelling.'
