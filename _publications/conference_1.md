title: "3D Characterisation of the Tensile Failure of CFRPs Manufactured Through Tailored Fibre Placement"
collection: publications
category: conferences
permalink: /publication/conference_1
excerpt: 'This work, presented at ICCM23 in PPT form, investigates the tensile response and 3D damage development in a [0/60/−60]s TFP‑manufactured CFRP composite using in‑situ X‑ray microscopy. Results highlight the critical role of stitching threads in influencing fibre bundle morphology, crack initiation, and propagation, while effectively limiting interlaminar delamination.'
