title: "3D tensile fracture analysis tailored fibre placement composites using digital volume correlation"
collection: publications
category: manuscripts
permalink: /publication/journal_paper_1
excerpt: 'This study presents the first in-situ tensile testing of a Tailored Fibre Placement (TFP) composite within an X-ray CT microscope, revealing that cracks initiate below 50â€¯% UTS and propagate mainly within fibre bundles along strain concentration bands. Findings show that stitching threads limit delamination, and results provide a basis for optimising manufacturing and laminate design as well as developing physically based multiscale strength prediction models for lightweight structural applications.'
